# Geo to numpy
_Reading unusual and or annoying file formats to numpy_

---

Here I collect code to convert some unusual file formats to Python numpy arrays and export to e.g. netCDF. 

Code here is not necissary optimised for performance, rather to be easy to follow and modify as needed. 

Some methods might be added to agrid later.
